Music Data Analysis and K-means Clustering
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of music tracks and performing K-means clustering to identify patterns and group similar tracks together. The dataset contains various features of the tracks, including acoustic properties, popularity, and other metadata.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
year: The release year of the track.
acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
artists: The artists of the track.
danceability: A measure of how suitable a track is for dancing.
duration_ms: The duration of the track in milliseconds.
energy: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the intensity and activity of the track.
explicit: Whether the track has explicit lyrics.
id: The unique identifier of the track.
instrumentalness: A measure of how likely the track is to be instrumental.
key: The key the track is in.
liveness: A measure of the presence of an audience in the recording.
loudness: The overall loudness of the track in decibels.
mode: The modality (major or minor) of the track.
name: The name of the track.
popularity: A measure from 0 to 100 of the track's popularity.
release_date: The release date of the track.
speechiness: A measure of the presence of spoken words in the track.
tempo: The overall tempo of the track in beats per minute.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations were created to explore the data:

Distribution of Genres: A count plot was created to show the distribution of different music genres in the dataset.
Music Trends Over the Years: A line plot was created to show the trends in music popularity over the years.
K-means Clustering
K-means clustering was performed on the dataset to group similar tracks. The following steps were taken:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for clustering.
Choosing the Number of Clusters: Various values for the number of clusters (k) were tested to find the optimal number.
Clustering: The K-means algorithm was applied to the dataset.
Evaluation: The clustering was evaluated using the Silhouette Score, and the recommended tracks for a given track were displayed based on the clustering results.
Results
The Silhouette Score for the clustering was found to be 0.15.
Recommended tracks for a sample track were listed based on the clustering results.
